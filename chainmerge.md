# What is ChainMerge?

ChainMerge is a **multichain infrastructure project** designed to solve a fundamental problem in Web3 development: the fragmented landscape of blockchain transaction data.

It provides a unified interface and deterministic layer for developers to interact with multiple heterogeneous blockchains through a single, predictable JSON schema.

## 🌟 The Problem
Building multichain applications (like wallets, analytics tools, or AI agents) is incredibly difficult because every blockchain ecosystem speaks a different language:
- **Ethereum** uses EVM logs and hex data.
- **Solana** uses complex instruction formats.
- **Cosmos** uses Protobufs.
- **Bitcoin** uses UTXOs.

Engineering teams end up spending most of their time building custom parsers and indexing infrastructure instead of focusing on their core product features.

## 🛠️ The Solution
ChainMerge normalizes this multichain chaos into a human-readable and universal format. 

### Core Components
1. **Universal Decoders**: Deep-parsing engines that translate raw, chain-specific data into a standardized `NormalizedTransaction` structure. They support 8+ major ecosystems including Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, Aptos, Sui, Polkadot, Bitcoin, and Starknet.
2. **Semantic Event Extraction**: ChainMerge automatically identifies and categorizes high-level semantic events like `token_transfer`, `nft_mint`, or `swap`—so developers don't have to manually interpret bytecode.
3. **ChainMerge SDK (`chainmerge-sdk`)**: A developer-first TypeScript/JavaScript client library with full type safety that simplifies interactions with the ChainMerge API into single-function calls.
4. **Alpha Nexus (Reference App)**: A demonstration of ChainMerge's power. It uses Google DeepMind (Gemini) AI and ChainMerge's tracking capabilities to monitor high-value transactions, extract transaction intent, and execute cross-chain logic.

## 🚀 Why it matters
By abstracting away blockchain complexity, ChainMerge enables a new class of **"Signal-Backed" applications**—such as Transaction Storytellers, AI Arbitrageurs, and Universal Block Explorers. 

For example, feeding ChainMerge's deterministic JSON into Large Language Models (LLMs) prevents hallucinations and enables complex reasoning over multichain transaction intent, directly bridging the gap between raw blockchain data and logic-driven applications.
